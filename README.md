# Introduction

This project implementation is based on cloud strategy and simple deployment. The primary purpose of this report implementation is to develop a cloud strategy for a small business which is “Polar “ is a graphic designing company in the UK. This analytical report deploys a strategy based on the cloud and sample cloud infrastructure which is an on-demand distribution of computing services such as application, processing of data, and storage data through the internet.

All the aspects of this enterprise named “Polar Graphics Pvt Ltd” like cost, security, scalability and resource allocation are analysed briefly in this report. Apart from that, this report includes the name and background of the enterprise, what are the IT set up and Recommendations.   

The main aim of this project implementation is to develop and improve a strategy for cloud small businesses. To determine the benefits of cloud computing for small businesses.

# Name of the Company 

Polar Graphics pvt ltd is a modern graphic designing enterprise which is located in Joel street farm, Middlesex, United kingdom. It also contains years of experience evaluating and testing products, and the quality of the signal processing range is high. It  has a huge track record of supporting and giving solutions in storage. As per the view of Jindal et al (2019), broad vogue and favoured imported cloud computing services in the past few years. 

# Current IT Set up and Recommendations

Polar Graphics Pvt Ltd are among the start-up companies that distribute and import products for several industries such as TV, film, and multimedia. At present, this graphic enterprise is dependent on an IT setup that contains traditional on-premise infrastructure. Therefore, a new IT infrastructure has been designed here using a cloud strategy. This company holds a dedicated server to host their website, file storage, and email server. Desktop computers have been utilised by this enterprise as workstations for graphic designing.

This analytical report involves a local network to protect and share the reputed files on the basis of SaaS which is also known as Software as a service. It is software based on a cloud service model in which the provider of the cloud implements and controls respective application software. The current IT setup requires a backup process and maintenance with human interactions as well as lack of scalability and accessibility. It delivers software that is updated automatically and generates software that is unrestricted to its consumer through the internet. 



# CRM- Customer Relationship Management
The Polar Graphics Pvt Ltd now uses a custom CRM database software on a local network.The software has been installed and allows accessibility for users. All the staff members who requires to login must have all the necessary applications installed on their desktop or laptop and stored in the off premises

# Recommendation:

Although enterprise-level organisations have the financial ability and know-how to pay for the highest quality software solution, they are aware that maintaining resources for small and medium-sized businesses demands a particular level of attention and concentration. Even if they possess requirements to those of bigger enterprises, smaller enterprises continue to encounter difficulties with sources like money, staff members, infrastructure, and other things. Users created the cloud based Bigin platform as a response to these difficulties. The features that are most important for small enterprises have been hand-selected. 

# Company Website

Currently the company uses a localhost host web server to maintain its website in which the data and information are stored in the local setup.

# Recommendation

Compared to solutions provided by non-cloud infrastructure, cloud solutions offer more reliability, scalability, and effective performance. This company website offers signal products on their website for their customers. By utilising Azure as the method of service, Polar Graphics Pvt Ltd will be able to contain more control on its website (Mikail and Pranggono, 2019).

# Email and Communication

The company is currently using Microsoft 365. Solutions that are Cloud-based such as Google Workspace provide document collaboration, robust services and reliable uptime. They are capable of eliminating efforts of maintenance along with downtime risks that are aligned with non-cloud solutions.


# Graphic Strategy Workstations 

The solutions provided  by non-cloud infrastructure are proper for workstations of graphic design compared to cloud-based solutions.

# Recommendation

No change



# File storage and File sharing

The enterprise uses a local setup which stores data in one location on a single device . The storage information is limited to the infrastructure and requires an internet connection to access the data.

Cloud based file storage and file sharing solutions such as Google Drive or Microsoft oneDrive suggest scalable and secure remote scalability, storage, and improved collaboration. They over power the restriction of non-cloud solutions by delivering easy access to share files and the file storage (Huang et al. 2021).


# Advantages and Disadvantages 

There are some advantages and disadvantages of making those cloud strategies during the deployment of a cloud sample for this Polar enterprise. Since information flows across various devices and locations, it is very flexible. Cloud service providers of this enterprise refine the architecture to supply the maximum amount of service continually which makes it reliable. There are some general risks that could be the reason for trouble like falling essential data, and data leakage, insecure APIs and interfaces and account hijacking could be another vulnerability or disadvantage in this case (Wang et al. 2020)

# Justification

The necessity for an affordable, secure, scalable, and resource-efficient IT setup justify the proposal for implementing software as service SaaS for Polar Graphics Pvt Ltd. therefore, SaaS provides a consolidated and accessible platform for email-communication, website, and customer relationship management. Here the business may improve websites speed take advantage of automated software upgrades, and foster corporation by using SaaS solution.Thus which to a cloud based infrastructure guarantees effective resource allocation, lowers maintenance requirements and offers future scalability allowing the organisation to eventually improve operations, boost productivity and meet the changing demands of their expanding firm.  

# Final Thoughts

This report concludes with the realisation that all the objectives and the primary objective of this project have been satisfactorily met. Create an approach to cloud computing that maximises company results, such as quickness, resilience and be capable and flexible. For the development of hybrid cloud architectures, embrace the distributed cloud. To close the skilled worker gap, establish internal public cloud expertise and take into consideration innovative hiring techniques. The following piece essentially outlines the advantages of the cloud for small enterprise and offers information on how cloud sample architecture may be established.
